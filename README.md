# FreshRSS-Nord-Theme

A simple theme based on Nord's color scheme for [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org)

You can see how it looks here. It features a compact layout and some custom icons.

# WIP
- Complete icon set, some are still using default colors
- Better mobile UI, some stuff looks janky
- Other fixes for small problems

# Installation
To install the theme, simply clone the repository into your FreshRSS theme directory.
Exactly where that is depends on where you installed FreshRSS, but it's usually in:
```shell
FRESHRSS_INSTALL_DIR="/var/www/freshrss"
```

```shell
cd "$FRESHRSS_INSTALL_DIR/p/themes"
git clone https://github.com/joelchrono12/freshrss-nord-theme.git
```
Clear your browser's cache and you should find the theme in FreshRSS' display options.
